What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- .git folder is being created
- saves all the information for snapshots and history, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
